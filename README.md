An [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) project dedicated to processing live data from Formula 1 races.

[Project's Website](https://racing.recursiveprojects.cloud/) displays live telemetry and analysis (Work in progress).

[Development & Demo Website](https://racing-dev.recursiveprojects.cloud/) displays telemetry of previous events to demonstate the functionality.

## Requirements

* [Elixir 1.14+](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html)
* [NodeJS 16+](https://nodejs.org/en/) to install NPM dependencies

Alternatively you can use `asdf` to manage tool versions, but be aware that it builds Erlang from source which 
[requires installation of additional system dependencies](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-erlang#before-asdf-install).

## Basic usage

```bash
# Install dependencies
mix setup

# Configuration file `.env` must be created by copying `.env.example`
cp .env.example .env

# Copy .env into your environment variables - the application doesn't read .env file on its own 
# Only works on fish terminal at the moment
source env.fish

# Generate documentation
mix docs

# Run locally
iex -S mix phx.server

# Run a backtest on an old session
iex -S mix backtest --url "http://livetiming.formula1.com/static/2022/2022-05-08_Miami_Grand_Prix/2022-05-07_Qualifying"
```

## Intro

To get a general overview of the data flow and processing in this project, you can explore the project in this order:

Example packet: `SessionStatus` packet with status `started`

1. `F1Bot.ExternalApi.SignalR.Client` receives the packet from live timing API
1. `F1Bot.F1Session.Server` calls the functional code to process this `Packet`
1. `F1Bot.F1Session.LiveTimingHandlers` determines and calls the handler module for this packet
1. `F1Bot.F1Session.LiveTimingHandlers.SessionStatus` calls `F1Session` function to update the state
1. `F1Bot.F1Session` updates its state with new session status and returns its new state + a 'session status change' event
1. `F1Bot.F1Session.Server` broadcasts the event via `F1Bot.PubSub`
1. `F1Bot.Output.Discord` receives the session status change event and composes a Discord message
1. `F1Bot.ExternalApi.Discord` chooses the configured Discord client module (live or console for local testing)
1. `F1Bot.ExternalApi.Discord.Console` outputs composed message ("F1 Session just started") to your console
